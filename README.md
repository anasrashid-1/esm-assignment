## Components
1. *NavBar Component (NavBar.jsx)*
   - The NavBar component displays the NavBar of the app, which is deliberately kept empty in this app.
3. *Hero Component (Hero.jsx)*
   - The Hero component displays the hero section which renders an image and has a translucent layer on top (set as background: rgba(0,0,0, 0.2) in this case), which can be altered accordingly. It also has a title and a button displaying the title of our app and alerting the "Hello World" message, respectively.

## Pages
1. *Landing Page*
   - This is the component which imports other components from Components directory and then renders it on the app.js.
## Styling
- The components are styled using module.css, with each component having its own uniquely named folder inside which there is its respective file.
